# Get started: publish descriptions

If you have used the registration solution to create descriptions and published them from there, the catalog will be automatically added for harvesting. If you wish to manually trigger harvesting of your descriptions, you can read about [how to trigger harvesting](/getting-started/triggering-harvest) or go directly to the [administration interface for harvesting](https://admin.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no/data-sources).

## Set up harvesting: Register a harvesting endpoint

If you manage the descriptions yourself and want to publish them to Data.norge.no, you need to set up harvesting in the [administration interface](https://admin.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no/data-sources). Here's how:

**Before you can set up harvesting for a new catalog:**

- The harvesting endpoint that serves the descriptions must be accessible on the internet (optionally secured with an API key).
- The data returned must be in one of the [formats supported by Data.norge.no](/getting-started/creating-descriptions-self).
- The data must be described according to the relevant specification. Read more about [how to create descriptions](/getting-started/creating-descriptions-self).
- You must have the necessary permissions to use the solution. Read more about [how to get access](https://samarbeid.digdir.no/felles-datakatalog/ta-i-bruk-felles-datakatalog/1619).

### Step 1: Log in

Log in to the [admin interface for harvesting](https://admin.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no/data-sources).

### Step 2: Add a data source

Click the button "Add data source."
