In this guide, you will learn

- how to create descriptions,
- how to publish the descriptions to data.norge.no, and
- which access rights you need.

There are two ways you can create and publish data descriptions:

1. You create the description in the correct format yourself and register a harvesting endpoint from which data.norge.no can harvest the description.
2. You use Data.norge.no's registration solution to register and publish descriptions.

## Preparation: Framework for Information Management and Getting your own house in order

Regardless of which method you choose, the organization should get an overview of the data it holds. Digdir has created a dedicated guide, [Getting your own house in order](https://www.digdir.no/informasjonsforvaltning/veileder-orden-i-eget-hus/2716), on how to achieve this.

Feel free to gradually create and publish descriptions to Data.norge.no while you work on the "Getting your own house in order" process. You do not need to have an overview of all the data or complete all steps in the guide before publishing the descriptions.

## 1. Harvest from your own endpoint

If you want to manage the descriptions yourself, you must create them and make them available.

## 2. Registration solution on data.norge.no

Data.norge.no offers a form solution to create descriptions for datasets, data services, terms, and services. Information models and events cannot yet be described in this solution.

## When should you choose which approach?

There is no definitive answer, but we can provide some reasons to choose one over the other. You can also select different solutions for the various types of resources you want to describe.

### Reasons to create and manage the descriptions yourself:

- The description can be managed closer to where the data itself is, which lowers the threshold for keeping it up-to-date and accurate.
- The organization is large, and the management of descriptions is delegated to multiple teams/individuals.
- The generation of descriptions/RDF graphs is part of an automated workflow.
- Many people frequently make changes to the descriptions.
- The descriptions need to be made available to others, not just published on Data.norge.no.
- You need to use fields in the specifications that are not supported by the registration solution.

### Reasons to choose the registration solution:

- The organization is small and holds little data.
- The organization is unable to set up an endpoint that Data.norge.no can harvest from.
- The responsible people in the organization want an easy way to create descriptions without needing to understand RDF.
- You don't need to describe more fields than those supported by the registration solution.

## Access and terms of use

Before you can register descriptions or register an endpoint for data.norge.no to harvest from:

- you must log in with ID-porten (security level 3),
- you must have the correct rights or role in Altinn, and
- the organization must accept the terms of use. This is done the first time the organization uses the solution.
