# How to Create and Publish a Dataset Description â€“ From A to Z

This guide takes you through all the steps needed to achieve your goal, from figuring out which dataset you want to describe to getting it published to data.norge.no! We will cover:

-   1. Preparations and mapping.
-   2. How to create the dataset description.
-   3. How to register a data source that data.norge.no can retrieve the description from.
-   4. How to start a harvest so that data.norge.no fetches and publishes your description.

Along the way, we provide concrete examples of how to perform each step based on the dataset "AI Projects in the Public Sector" from Digdir.
