# Help to Find Data

Are you unsure if the data you are looking for exists, or is there data you need that has not been shared yet? If the dataset is not described on Data.norge.no or on the data owner's websites, you should engage with those offering them and encourage them to share. You can use Digdir's services for this, by asking the Data Hunter or requesting datasets and APIs in the Data Village.

## The Data Hunter: Find and Access Public Datasets

The Data Hunter is a service that helps you find and access datasets from the public sector. Although many datasets are available via data.norge.no, the catalog is not complete.

You can ask the Data Hunter for help via a simple contact form. Here, you can describe what you are looking for. Some fields are mandatory, and others can be used to specify your request. When the form is submitted, it goes directly to employees at the Directorate for Digitalization, who investigate which agency owns the data and handle the necessary contact to obtain it.

## The Data Village: Request Datasets and APIs

The Data Village is an online forum dedicated to dialogue between data providers and consumers. Here, you can request datasets and APIs you want access to or have questions about. You can also request extensions of existing datasets and APIs, such as more available data or changes in API functionality. Visit the Data Village user forum to post your request. See the guide on how to request data in the Data Village.
