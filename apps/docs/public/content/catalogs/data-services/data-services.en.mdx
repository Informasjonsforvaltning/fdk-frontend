# The API Catalog

<Ingress>
    The API catalog in the Common Data Catalog ensures easy access to distributed data. Through the API catalog, machine-readable information can be retrieved about all the URLs that implement a specific API. The API catalog contains an overview of descriptions of the interfaces to data and standards that organizations have made available. Accessible APIs are essential for achieving efficient use of data and improving the quality of services.

## What information can I find in the API Catalog?

All APIs published in the Common Data Catalog follow the [Standard for Data Services](https://data.norge.no/specification/dcat-ap-no/#Datatjeneste).

Below is what you can find information about:

-   Description of the API
-   Formats the API is available in
-   Description of how to use the data service
-   Associated dataset descriptions
-   Contact information for the API owner

## Relationship to other catalogs

**Dataset Catalog**  
An API can have a relationship to one or more datasets. This means that the dataset(s) can be accessed through the API if a dataset is specified.

**Information Model Catalog**  
The information model can be specified in the API description. This means you can see how the data service is structured.
