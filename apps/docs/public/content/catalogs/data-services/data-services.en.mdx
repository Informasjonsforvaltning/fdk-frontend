# The API Catalog

<Ingress>
    The API Catalog in the National Data Catalog ensures easy access to distributed data. Through the API Catalog,
    machine-readable information can be retrieved about all the URLs that implement a specific API. The API Catalog
    contains an overview of descriptions of the interfaces to data and standards that organizations have made available.
    Accessible APIs are essential for achieving efficient use of data and improving the quality of services.

## What information can I find in the API Catalog?

All APIs published in the API Catalog follow [The standard for describing datasets, data services and datacatalogs (DCAT-AP-NO)](https://data.norge.no/specification/dcat-ap-no/).

Below is what you can get information about:

-   Description of the API
-   Formats the API is available in
-   Description of how to use the data service
-   Associated dataset descriptions
-   Contact information for the API owner

## Relationship to other catalogs

The different data catalogs in the National Data Catalog can be used separately, but many of the catalogs have a logical correlation and can therefore be viewed together. Here is a description of the relationships the other catalogs have with the API Catalog.

### Dataset Catalog

An API can have a relationship to one or more datasets. This means that the dataset(s) can be accessed through the API if a dataset is specified.

### Information Model Catalog

The information model can be specified in the API description. This means you can see how the data service is structured.
