# The Concept Catalog

<Ingress>
    The purpose of the concept catalog is to make data more understandable. Similar concepts can be used in different ways in various contexts. Therefore, it is important to describe concepts to avoid misunderstandings and incorrect use of data. All concepts published in the concept catalog have an accompanying definition that explains what the concept means.

### Compare concepts

It is possible to compare several concepts side by side. The tool makes it easier to find the concept that is best suited.

## Relationship to other catalogs

### Dataset Catalog

Many of the datasets published often have a relationship to one or more concepts. When you have selected a specific dataset, you can choose "Concepts used in the dataset" from the menu. Here, you get a description of the concept by clicking on the underlined text (as shown in the image below).

### Information Model Catalog

Common information models refer to concepts. This means models that are used across business areas and segments. You can read more about information models on the page about the [framework for information management (digdir.no)](https://www.digdir.no/informasjonsforvaltning/rammeverk-informasjonsforvaltning/3626). In the image below, you can see that concepts are defined and have a relationship to the information model.
