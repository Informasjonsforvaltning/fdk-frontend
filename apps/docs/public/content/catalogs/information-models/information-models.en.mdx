# The Information Model Catalog

<Ingress>
    The purpose of the information model catalog is to facilitate the efficient use of data. The catalog provides an overview of all published information models and the data services (APIs) associated with the model. Information models describe the information an organization needs to produce or receive to perform a service.

## What information can I find in the information model catalog?

All information models follow the [ModelDCAT-AP-NO](https://data.norge.no/specification/modelldcat-ap-no#:~:text=Denne%20spesifikasjonen%2C%20ModellDCAT%2DAP%2D,tilknyttet%20datasett%20og%2Feller%20datatjenester.) specification.

Below is the information you can find about the information models published in the Common Data Catalog:

-   Description of the model
-   Use of the model
-   Information model and its formats
-   Identifiers
-   Other resources related to the information model (other data services)
-   Who is responsible for the information model

## Relationship to other catalogs

### API Catalog

The Information Model Catalog contains the specification of the APIs available in the API Catalog. Therefore, a data service is often listed as a resource.

### Concepts Catalog

Shared models have a relationship to the Concepts Catalog. Some information models are shared, which means the model provides a common understanding within a specific domain.

## Guidance and inspiration
