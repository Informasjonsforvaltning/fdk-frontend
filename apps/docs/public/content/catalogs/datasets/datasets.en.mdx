# The Dataset Catalog

<Ingress>
    The purpose of the dataset catalog is to provide an overview of the types of datasets available from the
    organizations that publish in the portal, so that you can efficiently find the data you are looking for.

## What kind of information can I get?

The datasets published in the dataset catalog follow the DCAT-AP-NO specification. This specification makes it easier to find datasets by thematic areas, evaluate data quality, and find out who owns the data.

Below is the information you can get about datasets published in the portal:

-   Who owns the dataset
-   Title of the dataset
-   Purpose of the dataset
-   Key information in the dataset
-   Topic
-   Geographical scope
-   Update frequency
-   Access rights
-   Language
-   Contact point
-   Relationship to other datasets
-   Terms
-   Distributions

## Relationship to other data catalogs

The different data catalogs in the Common Data Catalog can be used separately, but many of the catalogs have a logical correlation and can therefore be viewed together. Here is a description of the relationships the other catalogs have with the dataset catalog.

### Relationship to the Dataset Catalog

A dataset can have a relationship to one or more datasets. This means that the types of information included in the dataset may also be found in other datasets in the Common Data Catalog. If so, you can find out by scrolling down in the dataset or by looking at the breadcrumb menu.

### Relationship to the Concepts Catalog

The dataset may contain **concepts** that are published in the Common Data Catalog. Concepts refer to types of information whose meaning is described using a definition. If the concepts in the dataset are linked to the concepts catalog, you can find them in the breadcrumb menu or by scrolling down in the dataset.

### Relationship to the API Catalog

Several datasets can also be accessed through an API. If this is the case, a relationship to a data service will be indicated under "Others related to this dataset."

### Specification for the data catalog, datasets, and dataset descriptions:

The dataset catalog and the datasets published in the catalog must be described according to the current specification. [More information about the specification.](https://data.norge.no/specification/dcat-ap-no/)

### Examples of usage

Did you know that datasets can be reused for new, exciting purposes? [The Data Village offers many examples of how open datasets are used to develop new and smart applications.](https://datalandsbyen.norge.no/category/2/gode-eksempler-p%C3%A5-bruk)
