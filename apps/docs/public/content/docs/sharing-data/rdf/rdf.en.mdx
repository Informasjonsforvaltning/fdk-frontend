# What is Resource Description Framework and Linked Data?

If you’ve come this far, it’s probably because you’re wondering what all the talk about RDF (_Resource Description Framework_) is really about.

## What is RDF?

So what exactly is RDF? Loosely translated, _Resource Description Framework_ means something like _framework for describing resources_, and this basically explains RDF:

- A _resource_ can be anything, including documents, web pages, people, physical objects, and abstract concepts and ideas.
- With RDF, you _describe_ the resources and the relationships between them.
- RDF is a _framework_ because
  - it is a formal and logical language,
  - it is a model for structuring data, and
  - it includes tools and algorithms for processing the data.

So with RDF, you can describe _things_ and how these _things_ relate to each other.
Since RDF is based on web technology, you can link your descriptions to others’, and we then talk about linked data.

## Why RDF?

There are several reasons why we use RDF in the descriptions published to data.norge.no.
RDF has some advantages that make it well-suited for a data catalog. Some of these are:

1. Interoperability:

   - a. RDF has a global namespace, which means we can talk about the same things across systems.
   - b. Different descriptions (such as datasets and concepts) can be more easily connected (linked data).
   - c. RDF makes it easy to reuse vocabularies and information across systems and solutions.

2. RDF is machine-readable and can be exchanged and understood by various data systems.
3. Semantics come with the data when using classes and properties defined in RDF; the data becomes self-explanatory.
4. RDF can handle complex data that is difficult to define in table form.
5. RDF enables distributed queries.
6. A large toolbox is available (for modeling, validation, queries, distributed data, and more).

Data.norge.no retrieves descriptions from many different organizations, so it’s beneficial that we use a machine-readable and standardized format like RDF.

The European data portal [data.europa.eu](https://data.europa.eu) is based on RDF and retrieves descriptions from, among others, data.norge.no. This means that data.norge.no must offer it in RDF.

All descriptions of data catalogs for both data.norge.no and data.europa.eu follow a standard called [DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/) which is defined in RDF.
