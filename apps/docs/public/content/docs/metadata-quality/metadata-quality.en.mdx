# Assessment of Metadata Quality

<Ingress>
Metadata quality is intended as a tool for data owners to assess metadata against various indicators.
For more information on the calculations we use for each indicator, check the details of the metadata quality for a specific dataset description.
This page provides an overview of the metadata quality of organizations and an overview of the metadata quality for each dataset description available on data.norge.no.
Currently, this only applies to dataset descriptions and not the other catalogs on data.norge.no.

## What Metadata Quality Means
Data.norge.no has four levels of metadata quality:

### Excellent
This is great! 75% or more of the quality criteria are met. The description is informative and highly valuable to users, which should be the goal for all descriptions.

### Good
50-75% of the quality criteria are met.

### Sufficient (should be improved)
Only 25-50% of the quality criteria are met, and the description definitely needs improvement.

### Poor
25% or fewer of the quality criteria are met. The description is incomplete and rarely meets the needs.

## Why We Measure Metadata Quality

We aim to help data owners improve the description of a dataset. By measuring metadata quality, we can identify which aspects of a dataset description have potential for improvement.
To achieve the goal of the "Once Only" principle, which emphasizes data sharing, it is essential to have good documentation of dataset descriptions.

Norway is also compared to other European data catalogs, where one of the criteria is the measurement of metadata quality.

## How We Measure Metadata Quality

The calculation of metadata quality is based on a range of criteria divided into categories according to the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

We have also referred to the European Data Portal's [methodology](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/mqa/methodology?locale=en) for assessing metadata quality.
