# Artificial Intelligence Search (AI Search)

The AI search uses metadata from Data.norge.no and helps you find datasets. By using natural language, you can search freely without needing to know specific dataset names, technical terms, or formats. For example, try "Which areas in Norway are protected?"

You can read technical information about data.norge.no's AI search on [data.norge.no's Github pages](https://github.com/Informasjonsforvaltning/fdk-llm-search-service)

<Alert>
	The service stores all queries and the number of hits in a database. The information is used to analyze search patterns and improve the search service in the future. The data cannot be linked to individuals, and no personal information is stored beyond this. Since the search strings are stored, we recommend not entering personal information in the search field.
