# Artificial Intelligence Search (AI Search)

The AI search uses metadata from Data.norge.no and helps you find datasets. By using natural language, you can search freely without needing to know specific dataset names, technical terms, or formats. For example, try "Which areas in Norway are protected?"

You can read technical information about data.norge.no's AI search on [data.norge.no's Github pages](https://github.com/Informasjonsforvaltning/fdk-llm-search-service).
