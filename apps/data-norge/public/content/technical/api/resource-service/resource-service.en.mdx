# Resource Service API

<Ingress>
    The resource service gives you direct access to resources from Data.norge.no through a REST API. You can retrieve
    datasets, concepts, data services, information models, services, and events, both as JSON and RDF graphs. The
    service that is responsible for handling the resource service is
    [fdk-resource-service(Github)](https://github.com/Informasjonsforvaltning/fdk-resource-service).
</Ingress>

## Endpoints in different environments

- **Resource service (production)**: https://resource.api.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no - Production endpoint
- **Resource service (demo)**: https://resource.api.demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no - Demo endpoint

## Documentation

[OpenAPI-specification for the resource service endpoint (Swagger)](https://resource.api.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no/swagger-ui/index.html)

## How to gain access

The API is open for public use and requires no authentication. You can start using the endpoint immediately.

### Rate limiting

The API has rate limiting configured to ensure stable operation. The limits are:

- **5 requests per second** (requests per second)
- **Burst limit of 10 requests** (2x multiplier)

If you exceed these limits, you will receive an HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) response.

## Available resources

The resource service supports the following resources. All endpoints are for retrieving specific resources, not collections:

- **Concepts** (`/v1/concepts/{id}`) - Retrieve a specific concept from the catalog
- **Datasets** (`/v1/datasets/{id}`) - Retrieve a specific dataset from the catalog
- **Data Services** (`/v1/data-services/{id}`) - Retrieve a specific data service from the catalog
- **Events** (`/v1/events/{id}`) - Retrieve a specific event from the catalog
- **Services** (`/v1/services/{id}`) - Retrieve a specific (public) service from the catalog
- **Information Models** (`/v1/information-models/{id}`) - Retrieve a specific information model from the catalog

## Retrieving resources by ID or URI

Resources can be retrieved in two ways:

1. **By internal FDK ID**: Use the endpoints `/v1/{type}/{id}` where `{id}` is the internal ID of the resource. The ID is an identifier that is only known on Data.norge.no and can be found by using the [search endpoint](/en/technical/api/search) or the [AI search endpoint](/en/technical/api/ai-search).

2. **By RDF URI**: Use the endpoints `/v1/{type}/by-uri?uri={uri}` or `/v1/{type}/by-uri/graph?uri={uri}` where `{uri}` is the RDF URI of the resource's subject. The URI is a global identifier that is unique and can be used across systems. You can find the URI in the resource's RDF graph.

### Finding the URI in an RDF graph

To find the URI of a resource, look for the triple that defines the resource type. The resource types are the same as described on the [SPARQL page](/en/technical/api/sparql#resource-types). Here is an example of a dataset graph in Turtle format:

```Turtle
<https://data.norge.no/datasets/12345> a dcat:Dataset ;
    dct:title "Example dataset"@en ;
    dct:description "This is an example dataset"@en ;
    dct:publisher <https://data.norge.no/organizations/example-org> ;
    dcat:keyword "example"@en, "data"@en .
```

In the example above, `<https://data.norge.no/datasets/12345> a dcat:Dataset` is the triple that defines the resource as a dataset. The URI is `<https://data.norge.no/datasets/12345>` (the subject of the triple). This URI can be used with `/v1/datasets/by-uri/graph?uri=https://data.norge.no/datasets/12345` to retrieve the graph.

For other resource types, look for triples such as `?uri a dcat:DataService`, `?uri a skos:Concept`, `?uri a modelldcatno:InformationModel`, etc.

## Example requests

### Retrieve a specific dataset by ID

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://resource.api.demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no'\
'/v1/datasets/{id}' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Retrieve a specific dataset by URI

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://resource.api.demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no'\
'/v1/datasets/by-uri?uri='\
'https://data.norge.no/datasets/12345' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Retrieve dataset as RDF graph

The resource service supports multiple RDF formats through content negotiation:

```bash
# Get as JSON-LD (default)
curl -X GET \
  'https://resource.api.demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no'\
'/v1/datasets/{id}/graph' \
  -H 'Accept: application/ld+json'
```

```bash
# Get as Turtle
curl -X GET \
  'https://resource.api.demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no'\
'/v1/datasets/{id}/graph' \
  -H 'Accept: text/turtle'
```

```bash
# Get as RDF/XML
curl -X GET \
  'https://resource.api.demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no'\
'/v1/datasets/{id}/graph' \
  -H 'Accept: application/rdf+xml'
```

### Retrieve RDF graph by URI

You can retrieve the RDF graph of a resource by using its URI:

```bash
# Get dataset graph by URI
curl -X GET \
  'https://resource.api.demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no'\
'/v1/datasets/by-uri/graph?uri={uri}' \
  -H 'Accept: application/ld+json'
```

```bash
# Get concept graph by URI
curl -X GET \
  'https://resource.api.demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no'\
'/v1/concepts/by-uri/graph?uri={uri}' \
  -H 'Accept: text/turtle'
```

### Retrieve concept

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://resource.api.demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no'\
'/v1/concepts/{id}' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Supported RDF formats

The resource service supports the following RDF formats for `/graph` endpoints:

- **JSON-LD** (`application/ld+json`) - Default format
- **Turtle** (`text/turtle`)
- **RDF/XML** (`application/rdf+xml`)
- **N-Triples** (`application/n-triples`)
- **N-Quads** (`application/n-quads`)

Use the `Accept` header to specify the desired format. If no `Accept` header is provided, JSON-LD is returned by default.
