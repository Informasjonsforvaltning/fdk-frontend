# APIs

<Ingress size='xs'>On this page, you will find information about the endpoints you may use to extract data.</Ingress>

There are two different ways to search for data on Data.norge.no through endpoints. They are based on different technologies. In addition to these, we offer a lookup endpoint for extracting the organization's own descriptions from the registration service. 

## Search for data on Data.norge.no

### Search

### SPARQL

The SPARQL-search is based on the rdf query language SPARQL, and is our most advanced and powerful search. The user has to make queries that follows correct syntax, but will be able to search in every harvested data points, not only pre-chosen fields. The endepoint is open for lookup, but it is not possible to write to it.
