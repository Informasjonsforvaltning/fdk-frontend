# Architecture

<Ingress size='xs'>
    On this page you will find information about the high level architecture behind data.norge.no.
</Ingress>

## Framework:

### C4

We use [the C4 model](https://c4model.com/) as framework to describe the system on different levels of abstractation with a consistent set of notations.

## Diagram

The relations between the components are illustrated in the following diagram:

A data provider that is employed by a public sector organization registrers and shares descriptions of data which the organization manages.
These may be registered in Registration, a data catalog that is managed by data.norge.no, or through the organization's or sector's own catalog.

Registration uses an identity- og access management (IAM) service that is connected to an external identity provider (IdP) (i.e. ID-porten) to authorize users. Registration search for data in the portal.

The harvester harvests datasets, concepts, APIs, information models, services and events from data catalogs automatically, both local catalogs and the one that is hosted by data.norge.no.

The portal listens to data events from the harvester and offers a search and overview over datasets, concepts, APIs, information models, services and events.

Metadata quality is a service that measures datasets up against different indicators based on the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). Metadata quality listens to data events from the harvester.
The portal gets a dataset quality score from metadata quality.

A data consumer that represents a business, researcher, or the sivil society finds, understands and uses data from the public sector through the portal.

You can read more about the architecture behind data.norge.no on [Architecture documentation on Github](https://github.com/Informasjonsforvaltning/architecture-documentation/wiki/Architecture-documentation)

The services are constantly being developed, as a result details in the architecture may change over time.
