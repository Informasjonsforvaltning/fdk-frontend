# SPARQL

The SPARQL service is the most powerful and flexible tool for searching the catalog. This tool allows you to execute your own SPARQL queries on the RDF graphs of data.norge.no. You can query datasets, concepts, APIs, and information models.

## What is SPARQL?

SPARQL is a query language used to retrieve data stored in RDF format. RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a standard model for describing data and resources on the semantic web. [You can read more about RDF here](/docs/sharing-data/rdf).

You can read more about the SPARQL query language in the [W3C SPARQL documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/).

## SPARQL Tools

You can test and execute SPARQL queries in our interactive SPARQL sandbox. The sandbox provides a user-friendly interface for exploring Norwegian public data and fine-tuning your queries.
