# Standard search with filters

At data.norge.no/search-all, you will find a text search with filtering options. This is the most user-friendly way to search for data on Data.norge.no.

## How to search

Here, you can search across titles, descriptions, and keywords in the data descriptions. The search will automatically search in all three fields simultaneously, and results will be weighted so that matches in the title are given the highest priority.

## Filtering

To narrow your search, you can use different filters. The filters available depend on the resource type. You choose the resource type by using the tabs below the search field. Examples of filters include:

- **Data theme**: Filter by which theme the data belongs to (e.g., environment, health, transport)
- **Access rights**: Filter by whether the data is public or restricted
- **Format**: Filter by data type (e.g., JSON, CSV, XML)
- **Open data**: Filter by whether the data is classified as open data
- **Organization**: Filter by which organization owns the data

## Sorting

The results can be sorted by relevance or publication date. By default, they are sorted by relevance, meaning that the best-matching results are shown first.
