# Retrieve resources

If you already know which resource you need, you can retrieve it directly from Data.norge.no without searching. This is useful when you have an ID or URI to a specific resource, such as a dataset, a concept, a data service, an information model, a service, or an event.

## What can you retrieve?

You can retrieve different types of resources:

- **Datasets**: Descriptions of datasets with metadata, distributions, and related resources
- **Concepts**: Definitions and descriptions of terms from the public sector
- **Data services**: APIs and services that provide access to data
- **Information models**: Models that describe the structure of data
- **Services**: Services described in the catalog
- **Events**: Life events and business events

## How does it work?

When you have an ID or URI to a resource, you can retrieve it directly. This is particularly useful when you:

- Build applications that need to retrieve specific resources
- Integrate data from Data.norge.no into other systems
- Need machine-readable data in different formats (JSON or RDF)

### ID vs URI

Resources can be retrieved in two ways:

- **ID**: An internal identifier that is only known on Data.norge.no. The ID can be found by using the [search endpoint](/en/technical/api/search) or the [AI search endpoint](/en/technical/api/ai-search).

- **URI**: A global identifier that is the URI of the RDF resource's subject. The URI is unique and can be used across systems. It can be found in the resource's RDF graph.

## Formats

Resources can be retrieved in different formats depending on what you need:

- **JSON**: Structured data that is easy to use in applications
- **RDF graphs**: Semantic descriptions that can be used for further processing
