# Access to Data

<Ingress>Data can be made available under different access levels.</Ingress>

## Traffic Light System

The traffic light system aligns with [the EU's classification for access control](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/concept-scheme/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/access-right) and is easy to use.

| Access Level                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## National Application Platform

[National Application Platform](https://frontend-soknad.paas2.uninett.no/) is a shared platform for applying for access to restricted or unpublished data. The goal is to simplify and standardize the process for both data providers and users, ensuring that valuable data can be shared safely and in a controlled manner.

As part of the pilot project, Kudaf and Samferdselsdata have developed an application solution currently being tested in practice. This solution enables users to submit requests directly via Data.norge.no or organizations' data catalogs. Data providers simultaneously gain better oversight of applications and can assess the demand for data that has not yet been made available.
