### Questions or Comments on Datasets

If you have questions or comments about a dataset described in data.norge.no, you can ask the question in the Data Village. We will then notify the data owner that a post has been made that they should respond to.

Please check if there is an existing discussion thread about the dataset you are interested in, or create a new thread in the [category "Kommentartråder" (Comment Threads)](https://datalandsbyen.norge.no/category/12/kommentartr%C3%A5der).
