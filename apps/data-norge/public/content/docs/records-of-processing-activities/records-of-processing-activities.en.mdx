# Records of processing activities


Records of processing activities is a solution where public organizations can register the data controller's protocol in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 

The solution allows for the registration of contact information for the Data Controller and Data Protection Officer and meets the other requirements for what must be recorded in accordance with Article 30 "Records of processing activities" of the General Data Protection Regulation. It is also possible to register other relevant topics connected to Records of processing activities, such as information mentioned in Article 6 "Lawfulness of Processing" and Article 9 "Processing of Special Categories of Personal Data". The solution was developed based on the Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s "[Template for the Data Controller’s Protocol](https://www.datatilsynet.no/rettigheter-og-plikter/virksomhetenes-plikter/protokoll-over-behandlingsaktiviteter/)". Additionally, we have included options in the Records of processing activities to link processing activities to the organization’s dataset descriptions in the National Data Catalog (optional field).

Records of processing activities is part of the registration solution within the National Data Catalog.
