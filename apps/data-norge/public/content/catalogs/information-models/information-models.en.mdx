# The Information Model Catalog

<Ingress>
    The purpose of the Information Model Catalog is to facilitate the efficient use of data. The catalog provides an
    overview of all published information models and the data services (APIs) associated with the model. Information
    models describe the information an organization needs to produce or receive to perform a service.

## What information can I find in the Information Model Catalog?

All information models published in the Information Model Catalog follow [The specification for describing information models (ModelDCAT-AP-NO)](https://data.norge.no/specification/modelldcat-ap-no#:~:text=Denne%20spesifikasjonen%2C%20ModellDCAT%2DAP%2D,tilknyttet%20datasett%20og%2Feller%20datatjenester.) specification.

Below is what you can get information about:

- Description of the model
- Use of the model
- Information model and its formats
- Identifiers
- Other resources related to the information model (other data services)
- Who is responsible for the information model

## Relationship to other catalogs

The different data catalogs in the National Data Catalog can be used separately, but many of the catalogs have a logical correlation and can therefore be viewed together. Here is a description of the relationships the other catalogs have with the Information Model Catalog.

### API Catalog

Information models can relate to APIs in the API Catalog. This means that how the API is structured can be described with an information model.

### Concepts Catalog

Information models can relate to concept in the Concept Catalog. A concept can be represented using an information model. From the information model, it can also be linked to concepts that are important for understanding the model.

## Guidance and inspiration

[Guide for information models](https://data.norge.no/guide/veileder-modelldcat-ap-no/)  
The guide aims to help public sector organizations describe their information models according to the Specification for the Description of Information Models (ModelDCAT-AP-NO) and make them available in the Common Data Catalog.
