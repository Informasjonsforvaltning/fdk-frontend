# The Dataset Catalog

<Ingress>
    The purpose of the Dataset Catalog is to provide an overview of the types of datasets available from the
    organizations that publish in the portal, so that you can efficiently find the data you are looking for.

## What kind of information can I get?

All datasets published in the Dataset Catalog follow [The standard for describing datasets, data services and datacatalogs (DCAT-AP-NO)](https://data.norge.no/specification/dcat-ap-no/). This specification makes it easier to find datasets by thematic areas, evaluate data quality, and find out who owns the data.

Below is what you can get information about:

- Who owns the dataset
- Title of the dataset
- Purpose of the dataset
- Key information in the dataset
- Topic
- Geographical scope
- Update frequency
- Access rights
- Language
- Contact point
- Relationship to other datasets
- Terms
- Distributions

## Relationship to other data catalogs

The different data catalogs in the National Data Catalog can be used separately, but many of the catalogs have a logical correlation and can therefore be viewed together. Here is a description of the relationships the other catalogs have with the Dataset Catalog.

### Dataset Catalog

A dataset can have a relationship to one or more datasets. This means that the types of information included in the dataset may also be found in other datasets in the National Data Catalog. If so, you can find out by scrolling down in the dataset or by looking at the breadcrumb menu.

### Concepts Catalog

Dataset can relate to concept in the Concept Catalog. Concepts refer to types of information whose meaning is described using a definition. If the concepts in the dataset are linked to the Concept Catalog, you can find them in the breadcrumb menu or by scrolling down in the dataset.

### API Catalog

Several datasets can also be accessed through an API. If this is the case, a relationship to a data service will be indicated under "Distributions and data services".

### Information Model Catalog

A dataset can have a relationship to one or more information models. This means that you can see how the data in the dataset is structured.
